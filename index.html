    <h1 class="heading">HELLO FELLOW VISITOR!</h1>
    <h2 class="subheading">Would you like to indulge in some mild 
        and interesting information regarding the the shape:
        Triangle?
    </h2>
    <div class="card">
        A Triangle is the smallest closed polygon with least number of sides : 3!
    </div>
    <div class="card">No matter how you construct a triangle,
        as long as it has 3 sides and is closed, the internal angles will
        always sum up to 180 degrees!
    </div>
    <div class="card">You can only have 1 right angle in a triangle at most,
        and such right angled triangle's sides follow the property of pythagoras
        triplets: Hypotenuse<sup>2</sup>=height<sup>2</sup>+base<sup>2</sup>!
    </div>
    <div class="card">The sum of any two sides will always be greater than the third
        side in the triangle no matter how you construct it!
    </div>
    <div class="card">With a strong base and strong support, the triangle is referred to
    as the strongest in holding its shape!
    </div>
    <div class="card">Triangle is actually a very important shape that it is used
        to build all sorts of building supports and trusses!
    </div>
    <div class="subheading">Now that you know how fun and important the triangle is,
        you can go ahead and check out other sections!
